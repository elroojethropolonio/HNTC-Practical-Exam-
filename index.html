                <h3>1. Sleep deprivation &#128564;</h3>
                <p>Despite multiple class suspensions, we still ended up rushing the research base that we were supposed to submit online. Before we knew it, we ended up staying up till 2 in the morning.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>2. Shenanigans &#128540;</h3>
                <p>While making the script through a shared doc, we sorta procrastinated and ended up joking around for hours before actually starting the script.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="activity">
                <h3>3. Pre-Practice &#128579;</h3>
                <p>Our practice was very delayed because apparently a groupmate had to chase down a person for rent money.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="activity">
                <h3>4. Recording &#127909;</h3>
                <p>After practicing, we were confident enough to start recording, using my computer, I recorded 37 clips in total (not including successful ones) and they all amounted to 28 gigabytes on my hardrive.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="activity">
                <h3>5. Editing &#9986;</h3>
                <p>I had to sort through and piece together about 13 clips to make the raw podcast. I then added effects and spent about an hour properly timing the background beat drop with key words throughout the podcast.</p>

                <p>I spoke gibberish for 2 minutes straight and people thought I was saying something complicated.</p>

            <div class="activity">
                <h3>2. Reliable research &#128218;</h3>
                <p>We were taught the different sources information and how to tell if that information was reliable. We were then told to research on the "positive and negative effects of social media"</p>

                <h3>3. Debate &#128483;</h3>
                <p>The class was divided into two groups (Pro and Con), each group compiled Information about the subject and debated using it.</p>

            <div class="activity">
                <h3>4. Arguementative essay &#128214;</h3>
                <p>My essay was handwritten and my handwriting isnt necessarily the best so I had difficulty reading my own essay. I ended up having to rewrite half my essay in pen so it was more readable and I had to memorize the rest just before my turn, I got really lucky here because there were many people who presented before I did.</p>
